### Arnav Chaturvedi
### Project Role: Data Analyst – Food Services Industry.

## Portfolio Project Overview:
A food services company (coffee shop industry) wants to manage its sales and financial information to track and monitor sales. The company also wants to create an application/dashboard which supports their finance department (managers + analysts) to analyze the data to uncover analytic insights to help boost their sales and improve performance.
This portfolio project for finance data analysis demonstrates the overall “end-to-end” lifecycle of a typical data analysis project within any financial organization, i.e. from business requirements gathering to development to the final UAT and delivery.

The solution’s approach and steps are described in detail below:
1.	Business problem scenario, objectives and KPIs.
2.	Skills and applications used.
3.	Solution approach and process to build this project.
4.	Data preparation process - Data gathering, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation.
5.	Data Visualization – Dashboard, Reports, Charts, Key findings, Data Insights.
6.	Portfolio Project Documentation – Final Conclusion.

## Business Problem Scenarios, Objectives and KPIs:
Financial managers would like to know about the following business queries. This dashboard should answer the following business queries. This application should also be flexible for further enhancements to handle any future queries.
* Identify the areas for sales improvements (such as sales by ‘coffee type’, ‘size’ etc) 
* Which coffee type/category is more desirable by customers? (slice the data by ‘type’)
* Which geographic location (country) has more coffee sales?
* How does a company’s loyalty card program affect coffee sales? 
* How can this dashboard/application be a productive tool for internal financial/business analysts for their day-to-day business analysis job?

## Target Stakeholders:
This dashboard application will be used for the following job roles to increase their productivity and achieve business goals. 
* Financial Managers
* Financial and Business Analysts

## Skills and Applications used: 
* Microsoft Excel 
  * Knowledge of advanced formulae and functions to be used in typical financial or analytical solutions.
* SME (Subject Matter Expertise)
  * Business requirement gathering skill and techniques.
  * Financial subject knowledge and expertise.

## Solution Approach and Process to build this project:
To achieve the company’s objective and develop analytical tools to support business requirements, I used the following financial subject matter knowledge and Microsoft Excel skills:
* Advanced Excel functions/formulae 
* XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, Nested IF conditions, Formatting: 
  * Used XLOOKUP for data gathering (customer data). Used INDEX MATCH for data gathering dynamically (product data). Lookup for data from various datasets using “Primary Keys”.
* Reports Visualization:
  * Trending Chart Report – Total Sales Over Time (Pivot Table/Line Chart)
  * Bar Chart Report - Sales By Country (Pivot Table/Bar Chart) 
  * Bar Chart Report – Top 5 Customers (Pivot Table/Bar Chart) 
* Dashboard Visualization:
  * Dynamic Global Filter: Oder Date (Timeline Selector)
  * Dynamic Global Filter: Roast Type Name, Size, Loyalty Card (3 Slicers) 
  * Dynamic report’s data refresh (Report Connections)
  * Visual Formatting, Styles as per company’s UI/UX standards.

## Data Preparation Process (Data gathering, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation): 
* Data Gathering – The Dataset (Microsoft Excel/ CSV File).
  * Orders: Transaction data for sales.
  * Customers: Master data about customers.
  * Products: Master data about products.
* Data Cleaning
  * Identify and fix issues in data such as null values, wrong datatypes, invalid values etc, 
  * Validate and prepare data to make it useful for calculations. 
* Data Pre-Processing and Transformation.
  * Validate and fix cell values – NULL values, Default values, Fix formatting issues, Create new calculated columns for further calculations/processing, etc.

## Data Visualization – Dashboard, Reports, Charts, Key findings, Data Insights:
* I created ‘Pivot Tables’ and related charts (Line Charts, Bar Charts) in the tabs: ‘TotalSales’, ‘CountryBarChart’ and ‘Top5Customers’.
* I created a new dynamic dashboard in new workbook/tab ‘Dashboard’ which contains 3 charts created above and global filters (Timeline and Slicers) to change data dynamically. 
* Please refer to the screenshots taken below for the dashboard, charts, and filters for this solution.

## Portfolio Project Documentation (Final Conclusion):
Documentation: 
* ReadMe-Data Analysis-Sales Analytics Dashboard-Excel.docx
Output File:
* Data Analysis-Sales Analytics Dashboard-Excel.xlsx

## Sample Screenshot: 
* Excel (csv) data file for “Orders” transactions data.
* Data file also contains “Customers” and “Products” master data.
* I created Excel functions and formulas in the “Orders” tab for data preparation for Pivot tables.
* I created Pivot tables and charts in the “TotalSales”, “CountryBarChart” and “Top5Customers” tabs
* I created a final “Dashboard” page to combine all 3 reports (charts) and dashboard filters (Timeline filter and Slicer filters) to analyze the data.

## Sample Screenshot: 
“Dashboard” page to combine all 3 reports (charts) and dashboard filters. 
* "Timeline" filter and 3 "Slicer" filters can be used to filter and analyze the data.
* Data changes dynamically as the user selects and unselects the options in the Timeline and 3 Slicers.
